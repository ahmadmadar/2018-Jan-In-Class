## Developer Environments for This Course

Our main tools are going to be

- GitHub Desktop (for version control)
- Visual Studio Code
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Use version 8.9.x

Additionally, we will be using the following Node packages. These can be installed from the *Terminal Window* via Visual Studio Code. You can open a terminal window by pressing `[ctrl] + [backtick]`. Then you can install the packages you need by typing the following:

```markdown
npm i -g npm
npm i -g live-server
```

Next, you need to edit the `path` in your environment variables to include the following: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm`
