# ESP Document 3

The third specifications document for Emergency Service & Product (ESP) presented two additional paper-based forms: **Inventory Control Sheet** and **Purchase Orders**. This portion of the sample lab solution details how this form was analyzed and integrated into the database design from the previous documents. The styling conforms to the associated [Legend.md](normalization legend).
