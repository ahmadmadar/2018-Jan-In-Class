# ESP Document 2

The second specifications document for Emergency Service & Product (ESP) presented one additional paper-based form: **Customer Payments Against Orders**. This portion of the sample lab solution details how this form was analyzed. The styling conforms to the associated [Legend.md](normalization legend).

## Customer Payments Against Orders

The Customer Payments Against Orders and its resulting tables are based on the following form (taken from the original documentation).

This form was analyzed according to the rules of 0NF (Zero-Normal Form), 1NF (First-Normal Form), 2NF (Second-Normal Form), and 3NF (Third-Normal Form).

### 0NF

After performing Zero-Normal Form, a single table was generated: **PaymentsLog**.

**PaymentsLog:** (OrderNumber, OrderDate, OrderTotal, FirstName, LastName, CustomerNumber, {Date, PaymentAmount, PaymentNumber, BalanceOwing, PaymentType, DepositBatchNumber})

### 1NF

After performing First-Normal Form, a single table was generated: **PaymentLogDetails**.

**PaymentsLog:** (OrderNumber, OrderDate, OrderTotal, FirstName, LastName, CustomerNumber)

**PaymentLogDetails:** (<b class="pk"><u class="fk">OrderNumber</u>, PaymentNumber</b>, Date, PaymentAmount, BalanceOwing, PaymentType, DepositBatchNumber)

### 2NF

After examining the *PaymentLogDetails*, there were no changes.

> **Note:** When analyzing the *PaymentNumber* in the *PaymentLogDetails* entity, it became apparent (only through looking at additional Payments Log forms) that each Payment Log had their Payment Numbers re-starting at the value 1. As a result, this *PaymentNumber* is itself tightly tied to the *OrderNumber* and none of the other attributes in the entity are tied closely to just the *PaymentNumber* (though some seem to be more related to each other, which is dealt with in 3NF below).

### 3NF

After performing Third-Normal Form, two tables were generated: **Customer**, and **Payment**.

**Customer:** (<b class="pk">CustomerNumber</b>, FirstName, LastName)

**PaymentsLog:** (<b class="pk">OrderNumber</b>, OrderDate, OrderTotal, <u class="fk">CustomerNumber</u>)

**PaymentLogDetails:** (<b class="pk"><u class="fk">OrderNumber</u>, PaymentNumber</b>, Date, PaymentAmount, PaymentType, BalanceOwing, DepositBatchNumber)

### Tables after 3<sup>rd</sup> Normal Form

These are the tables/entities after normalizing the Payment Log View.

**Customer:** (<b class="pk">CustomerNumber</b>, FirstName, LastName)

**PaymentsLog:** (<b class="pk">OrderNumber</b>, OrderDate, OrderTotal, <u class="fk">CustomerNumber</u>)

**PaymentLogDetails:** (<b class="pk"><u class="fk">OrderNumber</u>, PaymentNumber</b>, Date, PaymentAmount, PaymentType, BalanceOwing, DepositBatchNumber)

### ERD

The following ERD for the *Payment Log View* is based on the final 3<sup>rd</sup> normal form.
